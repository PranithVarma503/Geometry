# Foo et al. Parameterization

This software package calculates the complex Foo et al. parameterization. It takes the radius of a sphere and returns its volume.

## Design Considerations

### Modularity

The code is structured in a modular way to allow for easy addition of new features. We use interfaces and abstract classes to define common behaviors, and implement these in concrete classes for specific shapes or calculations.

### Usability

The code is designed to be easy to use both interactively and as part of larger software packages. We provide a clear API and good documentation. For interactive use, a user interface or command-line interface might be needed.

### Community Involvement

The code is structured in a way that allows for easy contribution from the community. We follow common coding standards, provide clear contribution guidelines, and use a version control system like Git.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Compile the Java files
